# [Node Graph Maker](https://meeraray.github.io/node-graphs-copy/)
_Javascript, Jquery, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap_  
As I was taking a discrete math course, I felt the disconnect between the static diagrams and the dynamic processes we were studying. We were on the topic of breadth-first and depth-first search between nodes of an undirected graph. While there are visualizations out there, they weren't adjustable enough to be helpful for me. Most didn't come with the automatic numbering of nodes that my course used by convention nor did they allow you to adjust the nodes' position. So, I created a dynamic web page that lets you create node graphs and see breadth-first search between any two nodes.


# [Countdown App](https://meeraray.github.io/countdown/)
_React.js, HTML/CSS, and vanilla JavaScript_  
Carnegie Mellon University is my second home, and I felt homesick for campus as I sat in quarantine. I made this front-end app to count down the days left until I could return, using an specially scaled icon for each day to help visualize the passage of time. I used official campus branding guidelines for fonts and colors, and set the background to a photo of campus. Since CMU has resumed on-campus instruction, I've kept this up but changed the dates to show my progress towards graduation.


# [Procrast-inator](https://meeraray.github.io/procrast-inator/)
_Jquery, Boostrap, HTML/CSS, and Javascript_  
I require significant structure to be productive, but existing techniques like the Pomodoro method are far too rigid to serve as a guiding model for my work time. I designed an responsive app that allows for flexibility but firm guidance. The user chooses five tasks to work on, and specifies a time limit for each task and a break period ranging from five to thirty minutes. The user may switch between tasks and take breaks as they please, but they may not leave the session or take multiple breaks in a row. The alarm sound, the timer design, and the color coding keep the experience engaging. I use the app almost daily.
